 HR Attrition Analysis Dashboard

Welcome to the HR Attrition Analysis Dashboard project. This repository presents an advanced and meticulously crafted Microsoft Excel dashboard, employing sophisticated features such as slicers, Power Query, and PivotTables. The dashboard serves as a robust, professional tool for comprehensively exploring and understanding employee attrition within a corporate context.

Dashboard Overview

This interactive dashboard harnesses the capabilities of Microsoft Excel, seamlessly integrating slicers for dynamic data filtration, Power Query for precise data transformation. and PivotTables for sophisticated data analysis. These features collectively offer an intuitive and highly effective means to investigate the nuanced factors influencing employee attrition.
Data Source: The raw data for this project was obtained in the form of a CSU file with 38 columns and approximately 1.5k rows. The data contained information about employee demographics, job roles, salaries, and tenure, among others.

Steps Undertaken

1. Setting Objectives:

* Clarified scope and objectives, aiming to gain insights int employee attrition patterns.

2. Data Collection and Exploration:

* Gathered HR attrition dataset from Kaggle.

* Analyzed the dataset to gain insights int employee demographics, job attributes, performance ratings, and attrition status. This involved visualizing distributions, correlations, and trends using descriptive statistics and data visualization

3. Metric Development:

* Utilized MS Excel and Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to create Pivot Tables and key performance indicators (KPIs) such as attrition rate, department-wise turnover, etc

Data Cleaning and Processing: Several steps were taken to prepare the data for analysis. Null values were removed and duplicate values were eliminated. Spelling errors were identified and corrected, and appropriate data types were assigned. Additionally, a conditional column was added for attrition count, which assigned a value of 1 for 'yes' and O for 'no' based on the attrition column. Furthermore, a new measure was created to calculate the attrition rate, which was derived by dividing the total attrition count by the total employee count.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): To start the analysis, I have identified the key performance indicators (KPIs) to track and monitor employee performance and attrition. The following KPIs were created with card visualizations in MS Excel:

1. Employee count

2. Attrition

3. Attrition rate

4. Average age

5. Average income

Some suggestions for the HR department to improve employee performance and retention:

1. Investigate the reasons behind the higher attrition rate among male employees and take appropriate measures to address their concerns and needs.

2. Identify the root causes of the high attrition rate among employees in the Life Sciences and Medical Fields and take necessary steps to retain employees in these areas.

3. Address the concerns of employees in the age group of 26-35, who have the highest attrition rate, and provide them with better opportunities for career growth and development.

4. Conduct a review of the job roles with the highest attrition rate, such as Laboratory Technicians, Sales Executives, and Research Scientists, to identify the reasons behind the high attrition rate and take necessary steps to address these concerns.

5. Review the salary structure of the company, especially for employees in the salary slab of up to 5K, and consider adjusting the salaries to make them more competitive in the market.

6. Provide training and development opportunities for employees to help them enhance their skills and progress in their careers, which can improve job satisfaction and reduce attrition.

7. Provide employees with a supportive work environment, opportunities for work-life balance, and recognition and rewards for their contributions to the company, which can increase employee engagement and retention.

Conclusion: This HR analytics dashboard showed important information about employees that can help make better decisions and keep employees happy and working for the organization. By taking actions to address the issues that employees face and creating a positive work environment, the HR department can help employees perform better and stay in their jobs longer. This can help the organization make more money and be more successful.
